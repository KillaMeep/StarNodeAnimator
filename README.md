##  Overview

StarNodeAnimator is an open-source software project that uses OpenGL through Pygame to generate visually engaging star animations. Its core functionalities include creating random stars with adjustable size and node generation chances, rendering them into frames, merging the frames into an MP4 video, and offering both GUI and command-line interfaces for users convenience. By providing features like user-defined screen dimensions, colors, and a Star class for generating and connecting star nodes, this project offers an immersive and versatile solution for creating captivating star animation videos.

| [cooker-opengl.py](https://github.com/KillaMeep/StarNodeAnimator.git/blob/master/cooker-opengl.py) | Create visually stunning star animations by running this script, cooker-opengl.py. It sets up an OpenGL environment using Pygame, generates random stars with variable sizes and nodes creation chances, renders stars, captures frames, saves them as PNGs, merges them into an MP4 video, and cleans up the frames directory. This is purely visual.                                              |
| [cooker-gui-v1.py](https://github.com/KillaMeep/StarNodeAnimator.git/blob/master/cooker-gui-v1.py) | Pygame initiates a graphical user interface, initializing screen dimensions and defining colors. Stars are created with random coordinates, sizes, speeds, and a chance to generate nodes. Connections form between qualifying star pairs. Animation frames are captured, saved, and compiled into an MP4 video..                                                                                  |
| [main.py](https://github.com/KillaMeep/StarNodeAnimator.git/blob/master/main.py)                   | Initiates an animation project, setting up Pygame environment with defined screen dimensions, colors, and a Star class for creating stars. Randomly generates 200 stars, moves them within the screen boundaries, and draws circles on the screen. Stars that meet a certain criterion create lines connecting them. The loop continually redraws the screen based on user events and frame rate. This is purely visual. This is a good example of the non-opengl animation loop. |
